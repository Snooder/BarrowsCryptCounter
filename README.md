# Barrows Crypt Counter Plugin

The Barrows Crypt Counter plugin is a tool for tracking the number of small NPCs killed in the Barrows basement in Old School RuneScape. This plugin helps players keep track of their progress by displaying a counter overlay for various NPCs within the Barrows crypt, including the Barrows brothers and other crypt creatures.
